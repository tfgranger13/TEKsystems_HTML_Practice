    <h2>Independence Day, Hot Dog Day, Ice Cream Month and More! <br>
        Here are the July Holidays and Observances In 2022</h2>
    
    <h3>Is July 4 a national holiday in the United States?
    </h3>
    
    <p>Yes, <strong>July 4</strong> has been designated as a federal holiday in the United States. That means that non-essential federal government offices are closed for the day (as are most public companies!). <br> <br>
    
        There are also several other holidays on July 4. Those are National Country Music Day, Sidewalk Egg Frying Day, and
        <strong>National Barbecued Spare Ribs Day</strong>.</p>
    
    <p>This is a test<br>to see if it is just the first line</p>
